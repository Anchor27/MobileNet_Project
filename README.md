## Cat-Dog Image Classification with Deep Learning

This project is an implementation of an image classification model that can distinguish between cats and dogs. The model is built using deep learning techniques and utilizes the MobileNetV2 architecture for feature extraction. In this README, we will cover various aspects of the project, including the model architecture, data preprocessing, training process, and usage.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can classify images as either cats or dogs. Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this project demonstrates the use of transfer learning, data augmentation, and model checkpointing to achieve accurate results.

#Model Architecture
We use the MobileNetV2 architecture as the backbone for our model. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture that has been pre-trained on a large dataset. We fine-tune this architecture for our binary classification task.

The custom top layers added to MobileNetV2 include:

Global Average Pooling
A fully connected layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
The final output layer with a single unit and sigmoid activation for binary classification
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

Data Preprocessing
Data for this project is loaded from CSV files containing image data and labels.
Images are reshaped to a consistent size of 100x100 pixels with 3 color channels.
Labels are encoded as 0 for 'dog' and 1 for 'cat'.
An ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation, which includes rotation, width and height shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping.
Training Process
The model is trained over 5 epochs with a batch size of 32. Model weights are saved at each epoch using a ModelCheckpoint callback. The training process includes data augmentation, which helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

Usage
To train the model and evaluate it, you can follow these steps:

Prepare your data in CSV format, including training and testing datasets.
Load and preprocess your data as shown in the code.
Run the model training code provided in the script.
The trained model will be saved as a checkpoint file.
Evaluate the model on your testing dataset to assess its performance.
You can also use the model for making predictions on new images, as demonstrated in the code. Simply load the saved model checkpoint and use it to classify new images.

Results
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the testing dataset. The test loss and accuracy are displayed in the console. Additionally, you can use the model to make predictions on new images.

Here is an example of how to make predictions using the model:

python
Copy code
# Load the model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model("your_checkpoint_directory/checkpoint.h5")

# Make predictions on a test image
y_pred = model.predict(new_image.reshape(1, 100, 100, 3))
y_pred = y_pred > 0.5

if y_pred == 0:
    pred = 'dog'
else:
    pred = 'cat'

print("Our model says it is a:", pred)
